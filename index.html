            <!--Explain a little bit about why we chose to travel to Rio, when we bought the ticket, who is travelling, etc-->
            <p>My name is Fiorella. I am from Argentina. Last Summer me and my boyfriend found a really cheap ticket to <b>Rio</b>, and we decided to get it since we have never visited this great city.
        The original plan is to be there from 21st November to 30th November.<p/>
