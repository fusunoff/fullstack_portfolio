            <!--Explain a little bit about why we chose to travel to Rio, when we bought the ticket, who is travelling, etc-->
            <p>My name is Fiorella. I am from Argentina. Last Summer me and my boyfriend found a really cheap ticket to <b>Rio</b>, and we decided to get it since we have never visited this great city.
        The original plan is to be there from 21st November to 30th November.<p/>

        <h2>Day 1: Trip from Bahia Blanca to Buenos Aires</h2>
        <p>We will travel by bus to the capital city of Argentina. This takes approximately 8 hours, and we prefer to do it at night,
        so that we sleep in the bus. We will book a seat that reclines as much as possible!</p> <br>
       <p> When we arrive, we are going to have breakfast at a coffee shop, maybe Starbucks, so we can fill with energy and get going!</p>
