    <h2>Day 1: Trip from Bahia Blanca to Buenos Aires</h2>
        <p>We will travel by bus to the capital city of Argentina. This takes approximately 8 hours, and we prefer to do it at night,
        so that we sleep in the bus. We will book a seat that reclines as much as possible!</p> <br>
       <p> When we arrive, we are going to have breakfast at a coffee shop, maybe Starbucks, so we can fill with energy and get going!</p>
